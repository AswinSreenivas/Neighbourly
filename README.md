Purpose: Neighbourly is a community-driven delivery platform that allows residents to request items from local stores, which can then be fulfilled by other residents.

Tech Stack: The backend is built using Django and PostgreSQL (with geospatial extensions). It also integrates OpenStreetMap (OSM) for mapping and uses JavaScript for frontend interactions.

Role & Team: You worked as a Backend Developer in a two-person team, focusing on building and managing the server-side logic, database integration, and geospatial data handling.

Project Scope: Developed within a three-week timeline, the project aimed to create an efficient, decentralized local delivery system fostering community engagement and support.
